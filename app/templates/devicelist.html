<h1>Devices using LVFS for firmware updates</h1>
<p>
  This list shows all the updates that have been pushed to the stable metadata.
  This is a very incomplete list as a lot of the devices in the LVFS
  have not yet been released publicly and the firmware updates are in a
  secret embargoed state.
</p>
<p>
  This list is automatically generated and will be updated when new firmware
  is added or devices are released to the public.
  For information about what vendors have been contacted about the LVFS,
  please see the <a href="/vendorlist">vendor engagement list</a>.
</p>
<form method="GET" class="form-inline mb-3" action="/lvfs/search">
  <div class="input-group">
    <input type="text" class="form-control" aria-label="search" name="value" required>
    <div class="input-group-append">
      <button class="input-group-text" type="submit">Search</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</form>
<p>
  If your device is listed but missing a firmware update that you see on the
  vendor website, please file an issue against the <a href="https://github.com/hughsie/lvfs-website/issues">LVFS website</a>.
